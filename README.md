# CS-390_Scripting_Project
This was a project for CS-390, Unix Development. The goal was to prompt the user for the last name of a CS teacher and scrape UAH webpages to return all of the classes that are taught by that teacher.
I achieved this with Python using requests to scrape the html from the webpage, and regex to parse that data.
